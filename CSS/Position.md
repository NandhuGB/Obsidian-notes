CSS positioning is essential for controlling the layout and behavior of elements on a web page. Here's a guide to the different types of positioning in CSS:

### 1. **Static Positioning**
- **Default value** for all elements.
- Elements are positioned **according to the normal document flow**.
- Doesn't respond to `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left` properties.

```css
/* Example */
div {
  position: static;
}
```

### 2. **Relative Positioning**
- Positioned **relative to its original position** in the normal flow.
- Can be moved using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left` without affecting other elements.

```css
/* Example */
div {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;
  left: 20px;
}
```
- In this case, the element moves **10px down and 20px right** from its original position.

### 3. **Absolute Positioning**
- Removed from the normal document flow.
- Positioned **relative to the nearest positioned ancestor** (not `static`). If no ancestor is positioned, it is positioned relative to the **viewport**.
- Uses `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` properties.

```css
/* Example */
div {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50px;
  left: 30px;
}
```
- In this example, the element is positioned **50px from the top and 30px from the left** of its containing block (usually the viewport unless a parent element is positioned).

### 4. **Fixed Positioning**
- Similar to absolute positioning, but the element is **fixed relative to the viewport** and stays in place even when the page is scrolled.
- Commonly used for headers, footers, or floating elements.

```css
/* Example */
div {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  right: 0;
}
```
- This will pin the element to the **bottom-right corner** of the viewport.

### 5. **Sticky Positioning**
- A hybrid of relative and fixed positioning.
- The element is **relative** until a certain scroll point is reached, after which it becomes **fixed**.
- Useful for sticky headers or navigation bars.

```css
/* Example */
div {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}
```
- The element will stick to the **top** of the page as you scroll down, until it hits the end of its container.

### 6. **Z-index**
- Works with positioned elements (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`) to control the **stacking order** of overlapping elements.
- Higher `z-index` values appear **on top** of elements with lower values.

```css
/* Example */
div {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 10;
}
```

### Visual Summary:
- **Static**: Default, follows the normal document flow.
- **Relative**: Positioned relative to itself, affects only the element.
- **Absolute**: Positioned relative to the nearest ancestor or viewport.
- **Fixed**: Positioned relative to the viewport, doesn't move on scroll.
- **Sticky**: Relative until the viewport scroll reaches a threshold, then it becomes fixed.
