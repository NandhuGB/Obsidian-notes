In data science, a variety of file formats are used to store, share, and process data. Here’s a list of common formats across various domains:

### 1. **Structured Data (Tabular)**
   - **CSV** (Comma-Separated Values): Simple text format where values are separated by commas.
   - **TSV** (Tab-Separated Values): Similar to CSV but uses tabs instead of commas.
   - **XLS/XLSX**: Microsoft Excel formats for structured spreadsheets.
   - **ODS** (Open Document Spreadsheet): An open standard for spreadsheets.
   - **Parquet**: Columnar storage format, optimized for large datasets and parallel processing.
   - **ORC** (Optimized Row Columnar): A columnar format designed for Hadoop and big data processing.
   - **Feather**: Format for pandas DataFrames, optimized for speed and performance.
   - **Avro**: Data serialization system commonly used in Apache Hadoop.
   - **HDF5** (Hierarchical Data Format): Binary data format for storing large datasets, often used in scientific computing.
   - **RData** / **RDS**: Formats for storing R objects.
   - **Stata**: Format used by the Stata statistical software.
   - **SAS**: Format used by SAS statistical software.
   - **SPSS**: Format used by IBM’s SPSS statistical software.

### 2. **Semi-Structured Data**
   - **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation): A text-based format used for representing semi-structured data (e.g., hierarchical data).
   - **YAML**: Another human-readable format often used for configuration files and storing hierarchical data.
   - **XML** (eXtensible Markup Language): Used for hierarchical data, often used in web services and data interchange.

### 3. **Unstructured Data**
   - **TXT** (Text File): Plain text format, often used for logs, unstructured notes, etc.
   - **PDF** (Portable Document Format): Format for document storage, often unstructured.
   - **DOC/DOCX**: Microsoft Word formats for textual data, though typically unstructured.

### 4. **Image and Video Data**
   - **JPEG/JPG**: Common formats for images, using lossy compression.
   - **PNG**: Lossless image format.
   - **TIFF**: High-quality image format, often used in research and industry.
   - **GIF**: Format for short, looping animations.
   - **MP4**: Common video format.
   - **AVI**: Another video format, often less compressed.
   - **DICOM**: Format for medical imaging data.

### 5. **Geospatial Data**
   - **GeoJSON**: Extension of JSON to represent geographical features.
   - **Shapefile** (.shp, .shx, .dbf): A widely-used format for geospatial vector data.
   - **KML** (Keyhole Markup Language): Used for geographical data in applications like Google Earth.
   - **GeoTIFF**: A raster data format for geospatial data.

### 6. **Big Data Formats**
   - **Apache ORC**: Optimized storage format for Hadoop workloads.
   - **Apache Parquet**: Columnar format for high-performance querying in big data environments.
   - **SequenceFile**: Used in Hadoop for large data processing.

### 7. **Compressed Data**
   - **ZIP**: Compressed file format for archiving one or multiple files.
   - **GZIP**: Compression format, often used with other formats like CSV (e.g., `file.csv.gz`).
   - **BZ2**: Another compression format, generally used for text-based files.

### 8. **Database Formats**
   - **SQLite** (.db or .sqlite): Lightweight, self-contained database file format.
   - **MDB/ACCDB**: Microsoft Access database formats.
   - **DBF**: dBASE database format.

### 9. **Specialized Scientific Data Formats**
   - **NetCDF** (Network Common Data Form): Used for multidimensional scientific data, often in meteorology and oceanography.
   - **MAT** (MATLAB): Format for storing MATLAB data structures.
   - **FITS** (Flexible Image Transport System): Commonly used in astronomy.

### 10. **Binary Formats**
   - **Pickle**: Python-specific format to serialize and store objects.
   - **Protobuf** (Protocol Buffers): Google's language-neutral format for serializing structured data.
   - **MessagePack**: A compact binary format for faster serialization of JSON-like data.

These formats each serve different purposes depending on the type of data being worked with in data science projects, from small CSV files to complex hierarchical structures like JSON and binary formats optimized for specific tools or performance.
