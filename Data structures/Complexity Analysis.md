Coding to solve a problem. Every problem have multiple solutions. but how to determine which solution is better?

complexity analysis helps to determine the  optimal solution for current setup or requirements.

there are two measurements. time complexity and space complexity

combined and called as space-time complexity:

### Time complexity

measure of algorithm running time. lower the better/ faster the better


### Space complexity

memory/space used by the algorithm. smaller the better.


some solution might have a different space-time complexity configuration.


### Data structures and space-time complexity role in coding

Data structures defined as "sets of data values and relationship between values and set of operations and function can operate on them".

and every data structures have different data values with different relationships and different space-time complexity with different functions and operations. 

by studying space-time complexity of different data structures on different functions and operations can code optimal solution for given problem using appropriate algorithm for required the environment.
