Big O notation used to represent space-time complexities.

its not the measure of the time.

Time complexity is the measure of speed / running time of the algorithm as the size of the input increases.

if the size is not affecting the speed: O ( 1 ) constant time complexity. (N size <->one step)

if the size is affecting the speed proportionally (speed  <=> size of the input ): O ( N ) Linear time complexity (N size <-> N steps).

if the size is affecting the speed twice: O ( N 2 ) (N size <-> N* N steps).


all the arthematic operation brings to constant space-time complexity.
		0(1),  0(log (n)), o(n),  o(n log (n)), o (N2), 0 (n3), o(n4), 0 (2N), o (n!), o(n! 2 n)


quick and merge sort have different complexity analysis depending on the scenario

big o notation represents worst case scenario.

there is big omega and big theta notation in the algorithm analysis. big o notation is enough for the coding interviews.
