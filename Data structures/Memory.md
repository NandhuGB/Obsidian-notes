1. memory is bounded (limited) canvas slots (can store 1 byte) in the computer which can store data in binary value.
2. basic measure of memory is called bits. 
3. bits are  0 and 1.  
4. one bit can either 1 or 0. 
5. 8 bits called 1 byte.
6. numbers are stored in memory as binary numbers (base 2).
7.  please read more about how different media are stored.
8.  in, java int means 32 bit / 4 byte integer and long means 64 bit/ 8 byte integer.
9. read about endianness - ordering of byte when it represented in the memory. significant byte to the left.
10. strings stored as ASCII code
11. Every memory(byte) has its own address in binary code. you can store address of memory(byte) in memory(byte). its called Pointers.
12.  we can access any part of memory extremely quickly. (fixed number of bytes/ 32 bit integer)
