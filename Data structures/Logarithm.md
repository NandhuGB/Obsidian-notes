in complexity analysis, logarithm is in base 2.

the algorithm with log ( N ) space-time complexity, when the number of input increases to double and space-time complexity increases by 1.

example : Binary tree search

note: when you are algorithm cuts the input in half every step of the way without any auxiliary operations (which increases the time complexity).
