### Big data

big data is described with 5 v's --> volume, velocity, variety, veracity, value

### Data Mining

data mining is automatically searching and analysing data and discovering previously unrevealed patterns and information---> preprocessing data, preparing, transforming-->
data visualisation--> machine learning & statistical models


### Machine learning

it is subset of AI which uses computer algorithms to analyse the data and make predictions based on  what it has learned, without being explicitly programmed. trained with large sets of data and don't follow rule based algorithms


### Deep learning

subset of machine learning which uses layered neural networks to stimulate human decision making. can categorise and label information and identify patterns, can learn continuous on the job by determining whether the outcome is right or wrong to improve their prediction

### Artificial neural networks

inspiration of biological neural networks but works bit differently

a collection of small computing units called neuron that take incoming data and learn to make decision over time. neural networks are often layered deep and needed large set of data to increase their efficiency.


#### Generative AI

subset of artificial intelligence. focuses on producing new data rather than analysing existing data

1. images
2. music
3. language
4. computer code
deep learning models like GAN (generative adversarial networks) and variational auto-encoders (VAE)

##### uses
1. natural language processing
2. healthcare
3. art and design
4. gaming
5. fashion and retail

###### in data science
1. synthetic data creation
2. code automation on analysis
3. uncover insights


#### Application of machine learning

1. recommended systems
2. predictive analytics
3. classification and cluster analysis
4. master basket analysis
5. fraud detection
