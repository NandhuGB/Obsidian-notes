To create a `ModelForm` for a Django model that includes both `OneToMany` and `ManyToMany` relationships, you need to understand how Django's `ModelForm` works with relational fields. 

Here’s a general outline and example to guide you:

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Create Models with Relationships:**
   - A `OneToMany` relationship in Django is represented by a `ForeignKey`.
   - A `ManyToMany` relationship is represented by a `ManyToManyField`.

2. **Create the `ModelForm`:**
   - Django automatically generates form fields for `ForeignKey` and `ManyToManyField` relationships.
   - By default, `ModelForm` will render `ForeignKey` fields as dropdowns and `ManyToManyField` fields as multiple select boxes.

3. **Customize the Form if Needed:**
   - You can use widgets to customize how the fields are rendered in the form.
   - You can also use the `formsets` to handle multiple instances of related objects (for `OneToMany` relations).

### Example:

Let’s assume we have the following models:

```python
from django.db import models

# One-to-many relationship (ForeignKey)
class Category(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Product(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    category = models.ForeignKey(Category, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # OneToMany

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

# Many-to-many relationship (ManyToManyField)
class Supplier(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name

class Order(models.Model):
    product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  # OneToMany
    suppliers = models.ManyToManyField(Supplier)  # ManyToMany

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Order for {self.product}"
```

### Creating the `ModelForm`:

```python
from django import forms
from .models import Order

class OrderForm(forms.ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Order
        fields = ['product', 'suppliers']

    # Optionally customize widgets
    product = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=Product.objects.all(), widget=forms.Select)
    suppliers = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(queryset=Supplier.objects.all(), widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Product (ForeignKey):** The `product` field is a `ForeignKey`, so it will be rendered as a dropdown. In the form, we used `ModelChoiceField` to specify it explicitly, but Django will do this automatically if omitted.
   
2. **Suppliers (ManyToMany):** The `suppliers` field is a `ManyToManyField`, so it will be rendered as a multiple select box. We used `ModelMultipleChoiceField` to specify it explicitly and provided a `CheckboxSelectMultiple` widget for better user experience.

### Usage in Views:

In your views, you can use this `ModelForm` as usual:

```python
from django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .forms import OrderForm

def create_order(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = OrderForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.save()
            return redirect('order_list')
    else:
        form = OrderForm()

    return render(request, 'create_order.html', {'form': form})
```

### Notes:
- **ForeignKey (OneToMany)**: Automatically handled by `ModelChoiceField`.
- **ManyToManyField**: Automatically handled by `ModelMultipleChoiceField`.
- If you want to deal with multiple forms for related objects (like multiple `Product` instances for a single `Category`), consider using `inline formsets`.

This is how you would create a `ModelForm` with `OneToMany` and `ManyToMany` relationships in Django.
